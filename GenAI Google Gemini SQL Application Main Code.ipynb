            "\n",
            "4. **Chelsea:** Chelsea emerged as a major force in the early 2000s under Roman Abramovich's ownership. They have 5 Premier League titles, 8 FA Cups, and 2 Champions League titles.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Manchester City:** Manchester City's recent success has been undeniable, winning 6 Premier League titles in the last 11 seasons. They also have 6 FA Cups and 1 Champions League title.\n",

            "**Other contenders:**\n",
